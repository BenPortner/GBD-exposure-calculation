# GBD-exposure-calculation
This projects attempts to calculate risk factor exposure values from [Global Burden of Disease](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) prevalence data. Currently, there is one Jupyter notebook presenting the calculation for "suboptimal breastfeeding" risk factors. You can read the notebook online [here](https://github.com/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/blob/main/suboptimal-breastfeeding.ipynb). If you want to manipulate the code, [download](https://github.com/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the notebook or run it online on [binder](https://mybinder.org/).
