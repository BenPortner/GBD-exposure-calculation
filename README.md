# GBD-exposure-calculation
This projects attempts to calculate risk factor exposure values from [Global Burden of Disease](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) prevalence data. Currently, there is one Jupyter notebook presenting the calculation for "suboptimal breastfeeding" risk factors. You can read the notebook online here. If you want to manipulate the code, download the notebook or run it online on [binder](https://mybinder.org/).
