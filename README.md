# GBD-exposure-calculation
This projects attempts to calculate risk exposure values from [Global Burden of Disease](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) prevalence data. The repository contains the following files:
- a Jupyter notebook for calculating "suboptimal breastfeeding" exposure for a range of locations. You can read the notebook online [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/41c3d1bc94a85df8288374639feafe0e424e339e/suboptimal-breastfeeding.html). If you want to manipulate the code, [download](https://github.com/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the notebook or run it online on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/HEAD?filepath=suboptimal-breastfeeding.ipynb).
- the exported exposure values can be found in .csv format [here](https://github.com/BenPortner/GBD-exposure-calculation/blob/main/results/suboptimal-breastfeeding-exposure.csv).
